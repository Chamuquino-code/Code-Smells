/**
 * Provides definitions of the notifications sent by monitor MBeans.
 * The notification source and a set of parameters concerning the monitor MBean's state
 * need to be specified when creating a new object of this class. The list of notifications
 * fired by the monitor
 * MBeans is the following:
 *
 * Common to all kind of monitors:
 *			 The observed object is not registered in the MBean server.
 *			 The observed attribute is not contained in the observed object.
 *		     The type of the observed attribute is not correct.
 *           Any exception (except the cases described above) occurs when trying to get the
 *           value of the observed attribute.
 * Common to the counter and the gauge monitors:
 *           The threshold high or threshold low are not of the same type as the gauge (gauge
 *           monitors).
 *           The threshold or the offset or the modulus are not of the same type as the counter
 *           (counter monitors).
 * Counter monitors only:
 *           The observed attribute has reached the threshold value.
 * Gauge monitors only:
 *           The observed attribute has exceeded the threshold high value.
 *           The observed attribute has exceeded the threshold low value.
 * String monitors only:
 *           The observed attribute has matched the "string to compare" value.
 *           The observed attribute has differed from the "string to compare" value.
