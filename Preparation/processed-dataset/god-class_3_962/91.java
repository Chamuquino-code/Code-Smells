   * point of the component.  The purpose of this feature is to allow
   * a developer to watch the table as messages arrive and not have to
   * scroll after each new message arrives.  When the vertical scroll bar
   * is at any other location, then no tracking will happen.
   * @deprecated tracking is now done automatically.
