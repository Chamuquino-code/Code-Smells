   * These lists are used to maintain expansions for which code generation
   * in phase 2 and phase 3 is required.  Whenever a call is generated to
   * a phase 2 or phase 3 routine, a corresponding entry is added here if
   * it has not already been added.
   * The phase 3 routines have been optimized in version 0.7pre2.  Essentially
   * only those methods (and only those portions of these methods) are
   * generated that are required.  The lookahead amount is used to determine
   * this.  This change requires the use of a hash table because it is now
   * possible for the same phase 3 routine to be requested multiple times
   * with different lookaheads.  The hash table provides a easily searchable
   * capability to determine the previous requests.
   * The phase 3 routines now are performed in a two step process - the first
   * step gathers the requests (replacing requests with lower lookaheads with
   * those requiring larger lookaheads).  The second step then generates these
   * methods.
   * This optimization and the hashtable makes it look like we do not need
   * the flag "phase3done" any more.  But this has not been removed yet.
